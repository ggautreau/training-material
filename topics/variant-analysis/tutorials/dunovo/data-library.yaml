  description: |
    Genetic differences (variants) between healthy and diseased tissue,
    between individuals of a population, or between strains of an organism
    can provide mechanistic insight into disease processes and the natural
    function of affected genes.

    The tutorials in this section show how to detect evidence for
    genetic variants in next-generation sequencing data, a process termed
    variant calling.

    Of equal importance, they also demonstrate how you can interpret, for
    a range of different organisms, the resulting sets of variants by
    predicting their molecular effects on genes and proteins, by
    annotating previously observed variants with published knowledge, and
    by trying to link phenotypes of the sequenced samples to their variant
    genotypes.
