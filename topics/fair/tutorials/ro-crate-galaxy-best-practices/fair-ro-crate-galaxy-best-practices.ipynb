A test case consists of a set of inputs and corresponding expected outputs, together with a procedure for comparing the workflow’s actual outputs with the expected ones.

You can follow along using any workflow you have created or imported during a previous tutorial (such as <a href=\"{% link topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/workflows/index.md %}\">A short introduction to Galaxy</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"community-best-practices\">Community best practices</h2>\n<p>Though the practices listed in the introduction can be considered general enough to be applicable to any kind of software, individual communities usually add their own specific sets of rules and conventions that help users quickly find their way around software projects, understand them more easily and reuse them more effectively. The Galaxy community, for instance, has a <a href=\"https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices_workflows.html\">guide on best practices for maintaining workflows</a> and a built-in Best Practices panel in the workflow editor (see the tip below).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\" style=\"border: 2px solid #dfe5f9; margin: 1em 0.2em\">\n<div class=\"box-title hands-on-title\" id=\"hands-on-apply-best-practices-for-workflow-structure\"><i class=\"fas fa-pencil-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\" ></i> Hands-on: Apply best practices for workflow structure</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your workflow for editing and find the <strong>Best Practices</strong> panel (see the tip above).</li>\n<li>Resolve the warnings that appear until every item has a green tick.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc\">Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC)</a> is a collection of highly curated Galaxy workflows that follow best practices and conform to a specific GitHub directory layout, as specified in the <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc/blob/main/workflows/README.md#adding-workflows\">guide on adding workflows</a>. In particular, the workflow file must be accompanied by a <a href=\"https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_format.html\">Planemo test file</a> with the same name but a <code style=\"color: inherit\">-test.yml</code> extension, and a <code style=\"color: inherit\">test-data</code> directory that contains the datasets used by the tests described in the test file. The guide also specifies how to fulfill other requirements such as setting a license, a creator and a version tag. A new workflow can be proposed for inclusion in the collection by opening a pull request to the <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc\">IWC repository</a>: if it passes the review and is merged, it will be published to <a href=\"https://github.com/iwc-workflows\">iwc-workflows</a>. The publication process also generates a metadata file that turns the repository into a <a href=\"https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate\">Workflow Testing RO-Crate</a>, which can be registered to <a href=\"https://workflowhub.eu/\">WorkflowHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/\">LifeMonitor</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"best-practice-repositories-and-ro-crate\">Best practice repositories and RO-Crate</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/crs4/repo2rocrate\">repo2rocrate</a> software package allows to generate a <a href=\"https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate\">Workflow Testing RO-Crate</a> for a workflow repository that follows community best practices. It currently supports Galaxy (based on IWC guidelines), Nextflow and Snakemake. The tool assumes that the workflow repository is structured according to the community guidelines and generates the appropriate <a href=\"https://w3id.org/ro/crate/\">RO-Crate</a> metadata for the various entities. Several command line options allow to specify additional information that cannot be automatically detected or needs to be overridden.</p>\n<p>To try the software, we’ll clone one of the iwc-workflows repositories, whose layout is known to respect the IWC guidelines. Since it already contains an RO-Crate metadata file, we’ll delete it before running the tool.</p>\n",
