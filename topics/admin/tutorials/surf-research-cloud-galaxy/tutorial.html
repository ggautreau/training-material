                <p>Using Galaxy via the SURF Research Cloud (SRC) allows researchers to start Galaxy instances on-demand and analyze their data in a secure environment following the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). The instance provides secure authentication, where users must have a SURF Research account prior to this tutorial, have set the SURF Research Access Management (SRAM) authentication method, and connect an SSH key to their accounts. In case you are not familiar with <abbr title="SURF Research Cloud">SRC</abbr> and need help in setting up your accounts, please follow the instructions on the <a href="https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/SURF+Research+Cloud">SURF Knowledge Base</a></p>

<p>In this training the aim is to focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding how to start Galaxy on <abbr title="SURF Research Cloud">SRC</abbr></li>
  <li>Attaching external volumes for storage</li>
</ul>

<p>Galaxy instances can be started and stopped on demand, depending on personal cases and requirements. Inside the SRC members should have access to all publicly available catalog items. If you are not able to create a catalog item, please <a href="mailto:servicedesk@surf.nl">contact SURF servicedesk</a>.</p>

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>

<p>This tutorial assumes you are member of a Collaborative Organisation (CO) in <abbr title="SURF Research Access Management">SRAM</abbr> that has access to <abbr title="SURF Research Cloud">SRC</abbr> and a wallet with budget in SRC with enough sources to create Galaxy and Pulsar catalog items. (For more information please refer to the <a href="https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Budgets%2C+wallets%2C+contracts">SURF Knowledge Base</a>.</p>

<p>You must have previous experience working with data inside Galaxy.</p>

<p>With this, you’re ready to get started launching resources within <abbr title="SURF Research Cloud">SRC</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="create-an-external-storage">Create an external storage</h2>

<p>The purpose of the storage is to attach it to your workspace, where you will save your data. This way, if the machine is deleted, your data will not be lost. We strongly advise anyone using the SRC to create storages and attach them to their machines!</p>

<p>Once the storage is deployed, you can attach it to any of your machines! 🎉</p>

<p>Be aware, that in order to attach an external storage to an existing machine, you would need to pause the workspace first! (If you are not sure how to do that please refer to <a href="https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/External+storage+volumes">External storage volumes</a>)</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Then, you will be redirected to a new page, where you must first choose the collaborative organisation in which you want to create your workspace (in case you are a member of multiple organisations). Once chosen, you a new page will be loaded, where you will have access to all available catalog items.</p>

      <p><a href="./images/9.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="./images/9.png" alt="Create your workspace screen showing 9 catalog items on the first page with pages more.

    <li>
      <p>Use the magnifying glass on the right side of the panel and search for Galaxy. Two catalog items will appear - the Galaxy instance designed for SURF and a Galaxy Pulsar node that can be connected to the instance. Select “Galaxy at SURF”.</p>

      <p><a href="./images/10.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="./images/10.png" alt="similar to previous image, but the items described above. " width="2952" height="1830" loading="lazy" /></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>SURF Research Cloud allows researchers to host their catalog items on different cloud providers. The Galaxy catalog item is currently supported only on the HPC Cloud and for Ubuntu 22.04. On this page, users can select the number of cores and RAM that they want on their machine. More sizes can be added in the future, and on request. Choose wisely and in case you are not certain contact your administrator!</p>

      <p><a href="./images/11.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="./images/11.png" alt="workspace creation screen, choose the cloud provider is locked to SURF HPC, flavour is locked to 22.04, and the size options are available from 1GB/8CPU to 60C/750GB Hi-mem.

    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
      <p>Lastly, before the workspace is deployed, you need to choose for how long the machine will run.</p>

      <blockquote class="tip">

        <p>The standard life-time of the VM is 5 days. If you need it for longer, this option can be changed once the machine is running.
Note, that once the machine is expired and deleted it cannot be restored! Plan accordingly and migrate your data in time to prevent data loss!</p>

        <p>This is an incredibly useful feature as it saves you from forgetting to destroy a VM. Especially for GPU nodes it can help you ensure that they disappear after your computation is complete.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In this form, you can also select how to name your workspace, add a description (if you want) and specify the hostname. Then, scroll down and submit the workspace creation.

<p>With that, your workspace will start being created.</p>

  <p>While you are waiting, you can create your Galaxy Pulsar node simultaneously to save time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the workspace is running, press on the down arrow to check any information such as the ID, the owner of the workspace, the collaboration it is part of, when it is created and when it expires and the wallet it is using. Additionally, you can pause the workspace when you are not using it. Pressing on the storage option will display the storage that has been attached to the workspace.</p>

<p>To access the Galaxy instance, press on the “Access” button. This will redirect you to a new webpage. The <abbr title="SURF Research Access Management">SRAM</abbr> login will be displayed again, and after authenticating, you will be redirected to the Galaxy at SURF Research Cloud page!</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have started a Galaxy instance inside the SURF Research Cloud! 🏄‍♀️🎉</p>

<p>If you have administrator rights, you can download tools that can be used by the members of the collaborative organisation. To obtain administrator rights you need to be part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src_co_admin</code> group inside the collaborative organisation. In case you are not sure how to download tools as a Galaxy administrator, please refer to <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/add-tool-from-toolshed-tutorial/">Installing Tools into Galaxy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="going-further-with-pulsar">Going Further with Pulsar?</h2>

<p>Another important step when starting a local Galaxy instance on <abbr title="SURF Research Cloud">SRC</abbr> is connecting it to a Galaxy Pulsar Node, which you can do <a href="/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/surf-research-cloud-pulsar/tutorial.html">in this Pulsar SRC tutorial</a>. The Pulsar is an useful component that is used to execute your tasks on remote servers/clusters. In this case, the Pulsar is started as a new workspace, allowing users to also run interactive tools.</p>

<p>In SRC, this can also enable you to save costs. By choosing a smaller Galaxy instance, and attaching a large Pulsar node when you need to do computations, you can be sure to optimise your budget expenditures.</p>
