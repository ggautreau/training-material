                <p>A neoantigen is a novel peptide (protein fragment) that is produced by cancer cells due to mutations, including gene fusions, that alter the DNA sequence in a way that generates unique proteins not found in normal cells. Because these mutated proteins are unique to the tumor, they are recognized as “foreign” by the immune system. Neoantigens are valuable in immunotherapy because they can serve as specific targets for the immune system, allowing treatments to selectively attack cancer cells while sparing normal tissue. By stimulating an immune response specifically against these neoantigens, therapies like cancer vaccines or T-cell-based treatments can be developed to enhance the body’s natural defense mechanisms, making neoantigens a promising avenue for personalized cancer treatment.</p>

<p>Creating a fusion database is essential in cancer genomics and personalized medicine, as it enables the identification of crucial biomarkers, enhances diagnostic accuracy, and supports therapeutic development. Gene fusions, where parts of two previously separate genes merge, can produce abnormal proteins that drive cancer. Cataloging these fusion events in a database helps researchers identify specific biomarkers linked to cancer types and design more targeted treatments. Additionally, fusion events may lead to unique peptide sequences, known as neoantigens, which are found only in cancer cells. These neoantigens can be targeted by the immune system, making fusion databases valuable in designing personalized immunotherapies like cancer vaccines or T-cell therapies. Some gene fusions also create oncogenic proteins that promote tumor growth, such as the BCR-ABL fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia. Including such information in a database aids in identifying potential therapeutic targets and predicting treatment efficacy. On the diagnostic side, known gene fusions serve as reliable markers, helping clinicians better classify cancer types and choose the most effective treatments. Finally, fusion databases provide a critical reference for researchers studying fusion mechanisms, their impact on disease progression, and their prevalence across cancers, ultimately fueling the discovery of novel treatments and therapies.</p>

<p>To generate the fusion database, RNA star and Arriba tools are used in this workflow.</p>

<h1 id="overview-of-fusion-neoantigen-database-workflow">Overview of Fusion Neoantigen Database Workflow</h1>

<p>The workflow in this tutorial guides users through the generation of a fusion neoantigen database, covering key steps in bioinformatics to identify, filter, and prepare fusion-specific peptides for further immunological study. Below is an overview of each major stage:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Get Data</strong> The process begins with the upload and quality assessment of raw sequencing data, which is then uncompressed. This stage sets the groundwork for all subsequent analyses.</li>
  <li><strong>Fusion Detection and Alignment</strong> RNA sequencing data undergoes alignment to a reference genome using tools like <strong>RNA STAR</strong>, followed by <strong>Arriba</strong> to detect fusion events. These tools identify gene fusions and help characterize the gene segments that combine to form new fusion genes.</li>
  <li><strong>Filtering and Refinement</strong> After identifying fusions, various filters are applied to remove non-specific or common fusion events using blacklist data and other criteria. This step ensures that only relevant, unique fusion events are retained for neoantigen prediction.</li>
  <li><strong>Peptide Sequence Extraction and Formatting</strong>
Potential neoantigen peptides are extracted from the fusion gene sequences. Using tools such as <strong>Text Reformatting</strong> and <strong>Tabular-to-FASTA</strong>, the data is transformed into formats suitable for further immunological analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Database Formatting</strong>
The workflow concludes by applying regex adjustments and formatting functions to standardize the output, creating a database of potential fusion neoantigens.</li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, this workflow provides a structured approach to preparing fusion neoantigen data for downstream applications, such as immunotherapy research, by making fusion-derived peptides accessible in a database for experimental or clinical exploration.</p>

This is shown on the left side of the figure. It is hard to trace which datasets contain “plus” data versus “minus” data. For example, does dataset 10 contain “plus” data or “minus” data? Probably “minus” but are you sure? In the case of a small history like the one shown here, it is possible to trace this manually but as the size of a history grows it will become very challenging.</p>   <p>The right side of the figure shows exactly the same analysis, but using name tags. When the analysis was conducted datasets 4 and 5 were tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#plus</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#minus</code>, respectively. When they were used as inputs to Macs2 resulting datasets 6 and 8 automatically inherited them and so on… As a result it is straightforward to trace both branches (plus and minus) of this analysis.</p>   <p>More information is in a <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/name-tags/tutorial.html">dedicated #nametag tutorial</a>.</p>   <!-- Image is here = https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iiNsau6ddiE2MV9qMyekUq2mrpDHHcc02bXtcFEAnhY/edit?usp=sharing --> </blockquote>

<h2 id="convert-compressed-file-to-uncompressed">Convert compressed file to uncompressed</h2>

<p>Uncompressing data is a crucial first step in many bioinformatics workflows because raw sequencing data files, especially from high-throughput sequencing, are often stored in compressed formats (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gz</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zip</code>) to save storage space and facilitate faster data transfer. Compressed files need to be uncompressed to make the data readable and accessible for analysis tools, which generally require the data to be in plain text or other compatible formats. By uncompressing these files, we ensure that downstream applications can efficiently process and analyze the raw sequencing data without compatibility issues related to compression. In this workflow, we do that for both forward and reverse files.</p>

<h1 id="alignment-with-rna-star">Alignment with RNA STAR</h1>

<p><strong>RNA STAR</strong> (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) is a high-performance tool used to align RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads to a reference genome. It identifies the best matches between RNA reads and genome sequences by detecting exon-exon junctions, which are critical for accurately mapping reads from spliced transcripts. RNA STAR uses a “two-pass” mapping approach that first identifies splice junctions across all reads and then uses these junctions to guide a more accurate alignment on the second pass. This capability is especially valuable for studying gene expression, discovering novel splice variants, and identifying fusion genes in cancer and other disease research. The output includes aligned sequences that can be used in subsequent steps of bioinformatics pipelines, such as fusion detection and differential expression analysis.</p>

      <li>STAR is a tool for aligning RNA-Seq reads to a reference genome, helping researchers understand gene expression and identify splice junctions. STAR requires RNA-Seq reads, usually in FASTQ format. It also needs a reference genome file in FASTA format and annotation files in GTF/GFF format to build an index. STAR outputs alignments in BAM/SAM format, as well as splice junction files. It can also provide additional alignment stats in log files.</li>
      <li>STAR provides logs with mapping statistics, such as the percentage of uniquely mapped reads, which can be useful for quality control. Aligned BAM files from STAR can be visualized in genome browsers like IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) to examine coverage and splicing.</li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>The workflow outlined above demonstrates a systematic approach to processing biological data, emphasizing the importance of each step in ensuring accurate and reliable results. By integrating tools like RNA-STAR for alignment and Arriba for structural variant detection, researchers can effectively analyze complex genomic information. The transition from tabular data to FASTA format and the application of regex for find-and-replace operations further streamline data management, enhancing efficiency and clarity. Ultimately, this workflow not only facilitates the identification of neoantigens but also contributes to the broader goals of personalized medicine and targeted therapies. By leveraging these methodologies, researchers can gain deeper insights into the genetic underpinnings of diseases and advance the development of innovative treatments.</p>
