                <p>Verification is an essential step in the process of analyzing neoantigens to ensure that the identified peptides or proteins are accurate and reliable. Neoantigens, which are novel antigens arising from tumor-specific mutations, are crucial for cancer immunotherapy. However, the prediction and identification of these neoantigens must be rigorously validated to ensure they are truly present and capable of eliciting an immune response. Without proper verification, the therapeutic potential of neoantigens cannot be realized, leading to wasted resources and failed treatments.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will guide you through a series of bioinformatics tools used to verify novel peptides and proteins predicted from mass spectrometry data. These tools help confirm the presence and specificity of the identified neoantigens by comparing them to protein databases, checking for validation against spectral data, and performing sequence analysis.</p>

<h2 id="pepquery2-verification-workflow">PepQuery2 Verification Workflow</h2>

<p>This workflow involves several key steps to validate neoantigens identified through mass spectrometry data. Each step leverages bioinformatics tools to ensure that the predicted peptides or proteins are accurate and can be used for further therapeutic research. Below are the detailed steps of this workflow:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Get Data</strong> The first step in the workflow involves gathering and uploading the necessary mass spectrometry (MS) data files. These files, which include raw spectra or peptide data, are essential for identifying potential neoantigens. Proper data organization and renaming ensure that the workflow executes smoothly.</li>
  <li><strong>Preprocessing Raw MS Data with msconvert</strong> Next, the raw MS data files are preprocessed using msconvert to convert them into a suitable format for analysis, specifically the Mascot Generic Format (MGF). This step is critical for transforming the data into a structured format that can be analyzed using peptide validation tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Peptide Validation with PepQuery2</strong> Once the data is preprocessed, PepQuery2 is employed to validate the peptides. This tool compares the identified peptides against a protein reference database, using MS/MS data to confirm their authenticity. It ensures that the identified peptides are truly valid and not false positives, which is essential for identifying reliable neoantigens.</li>
  <li><strong>Filtering Tabular Data</strong> After peptide validation, Query Tabular is used to filter the results. This step narrows down the data by focusing on specific criteria such as peptide match status and spectrum quality, ensuring only the most relevant peptides are retained for further analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Converting Data to FASTA Format</strong> The validated and filtered peptides are then converted into a FASTA format using the Tabular-to-FASTA tool. This format is commonly used for sequence analysis and provides a standardized structure for further processing of the data.</li>
  <li><strong>BLAST-P Sequence Alignment</strong> In the next step, the peptides are subjected to sequence alignment using NCBI BLAST+ blastp against a protein database. This step helps confirm whether the peptides are novel or match known proteins, adding an extra layer of validation to ensure their potential as therapeutic neoantigens.</li>
  <li><strong>Refining Data with Query Tabular</strong> Following the BLAST alignment, Query Tabular is used again to filter out peptides that do not meet the criteria or are not novel. This step helps ensure that only the most promising neoantigen candidates remain for further investigation.</li>
  <li><strong>Summary of Results</strong> The final step involves summarizing the results, which include the validated and refined peptides identified as potential neoantigens. These findings are organized and presented for interpretation, providing valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of the identified neoantigens for immunotherapy.</li>

The unique feature of these tags is that they <em>propagate</em>: if a dataset is labelled with a name tag, all derivatives (children) of this dataset will automatically inherit this tag (see below). The figure below explains why this is so useful. Consider the following analysis (numbers in parenthesis correspond to dataset numbers in the figure below):</p>   <ol>   <li>a set of forward and reverse reads (datasets 1 and 2) is mapped against a reference using <span><strong>Bowtie2</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> generating dataset 3;</li>   <li>dataset 3 is used to calculate read coverage using <span><strong>BedTools Genome Coverage</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>separately</em> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> strands.

This is shown on the left side of the figure. It is hard to trace which datasets contain “plus” data versus “minus” data. For example, does dataset 10 contain “plus” data or “minus” data? Probably “minus” but are you sure? In the case of a small history like the one shown here, it is possible to trace this manually but as the size of a history grows it will become very challenging.</p>   <p>The right side of the figure shows exactly the same analysis, but using name tags. When the analysis was conducted datasets 4 and 5 were tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#plus</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#minus</code>, respectively. When they were used as inputs to Macs2 resulting datasets 6 and 8 automatically inherited them and so on… As a result it is straightforward to trace both branches (plus and minus) of this analysis.</p>   <p>More information is in a <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/name-tags/tutorial.html">dedicated #nametag tutorial</a>.</p>   <!-- Image is here = https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iiNsau6ddiE2MV9qMyekUq2mrpDHHcc02bXtcFEAnhY/edit?usp=sharing --> </blockquote>

<h2 id="preprocessing-raw-ms-data-with-msconvert">Preprocessing Raw MS Data with msconvert</h2>
<p>msconvert is a tool used to preprocess raw mass spectrometry (MS) data files by converting them into a compatible format for downstream analysis. In this workflow, msconvert is employed to convert the input unrefined MS data into Mascot Generic Format (MGF), a standardized format for storing peptide and protein data. Additionally, during this step, peak picking is applied to identify the most relevant peaks from the raw spectra, which improves the quality of the data. However, the charge state recalculation is disabled as it’s not necessary for the subsequent analysis. By converting the raw data into MGF format, msconvert prepares the dataset for further processing in tools like PepQuery2 and BLAST, ensuring that the data is in the right format for peptide identification and validation.</p>

<h2 id="peptide-validation-with-pepquery2">Peptide Validation with PepQuery2</h2>

<p>PepQuery2 is a tool used to validate novel peptides and proteins by searching mass spectrometry data against a reference protein database. In this workflow, PepQuery2 is used for peptide validation, specifically focusing on the detection of novel peptides or proteins. The input data includes a list of peptides (obtained from a previous step) and a protein reference database, which is also provided from the workflow history. The spectrum file, generated by msconvert, is used to search for peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). The tool is configured with specific parameters, such as peptide charge and length, and the fragmentation method (CID/HCD). The output will help identify novel peptides that may not be present in the reference database, aiding in the discovery of potential new biomarkers or proteins.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>“Non enzyme” is selected because, in this workflow, the peptides are already prepared and may not require digestion by a specific enzyme. This option allows for the validation of the peptides without applying any enzyme-specific cleavage rules.</li>
      <li>CID (Collision-Induced Dissociation) and HCD (Higher Energy Collisional Dissociation) are fragmentation techniques used to break peptides into smaller ions for analysis. These methods are commonly employed to improve the identification of peptides in mass spectrometry by generating clearer and more interpretable spectra, which is essential for accurate peptide validation.</li>

<h2 id="filtering-tabular-data-with-query-tabular">Filtering Tabular Data with <strong>Query Tabular</strong></h2>

<p>Query Tabular is a tool used to query tabular datasets using SQL-like commands. In this step, the tool is used to filter and extract specific data from the results generated by PepQuery2 (specifically the psm_rank_txt dataset). The query provided selects specific columns from the table where a condition is met. This allows the user to filter the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) based on certain criteria, such as identifying PSMs that were validated with a “Yes” condition. The tool helps organize the data into a more manageable and relevant format for further analysis.</p>

<p>Tabular-to-FASTA is a tool used to convert tabular data into the FASTA format, commonly used for storing sequence data. In this step, the tool takes the output of the Query Tabular step, which contains the filtered peptide data, and converts it into a FASTA format. The parameters specify which columns in the tabular data correspond to the sequence (c1) and the title (c[‘2’]). The output will be a FASTA file where each peptide sequence is accompanied by its associated title or identifier. This conversion is crucial for further analysis, such as alignment or database searches, using sequence data in FASTA format. This database is being generated for BLAST-P searching.</p>

<h2 id="blast-p-sequence-alignment">BLAST-P Sequence Alignment</h2>
<p>In this step, the NCBI BLAST+ blastp tool is used for performing protein sequence alignment.

<p>The Query Tabular tool is used in this workflow to filter and organize data from previous steps. In this case, it processes the output from the NCBI BLAST+ blastp tool, which contains protein sequence alignment results. The tool allows the user to execute SQL-like queries on the tabular data, enabling filtering and sorting based on specific criteria. For example, the query selects distinct peptides from the pep table that are not perfectly aligned (i.e., with a sequence identity of 100%) and have certain mismatches or gaps in the alignment. The filtered results are then used for further analysis.</p>

<p>The tool helps to refine the data by removing sequences that meet specific criteria, such as perfect alignment, and ensuring that the remaining sequences meet the necessary quality standards for further exploration. The output of this tool is the novel peptides identified from the datasets.</p>

      <li>Sequences with 100% identity are filtered out to focus on those that show variability in the alignment, which might indicate novel or significant biological differences worth exploring.</li>
      <li>SQL-like queries allow for efficient data manipulation and filtering, enabling users to extract only the most relevant results based on complex conditions (such as mismatches, gaps, or alignment length).</li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This workflow effectively integrates several bioinformatics tools to process, analyze, and refine protein sequence data. Starting from raw MS data, through peptide identification and database querying, to sequence alignment and filtering, each tool serves a specific purpose in ensuring that only the most relevant sequences are selected for further analysis. By utilizing Query Tabular in particular, users can apply custom SQL-like queries to filter out sequences based on specific criteria, which helps focus on the most promising data. The final results in this workflow are the neoantigen peptides which will be then used for further interpretation and exploration, enabling researchers to gain valuable insights into protein sequences with high confidence and precision. This approach highlights the power of combining multiple tools and techniques in a streamlined bioinformatics workflow to tackle complex data analysis challenges.</p>
