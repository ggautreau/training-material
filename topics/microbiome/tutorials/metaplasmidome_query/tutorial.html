                <p>Identifying and annotating mobile genetic elements (MGE) in metagenomic data can be tricky. To facilitate the process, we can use existing and custom annotated mobile genetic element database.</p>

<p>The <em>metaplasmidome</em> refers to the collection of all plasmids present within a given environment, typically identified through metagenomic sequencing. Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements that often carry genes associated with antibiotic resistance, virulence, or metabolic functions, making them crucial for microbial adaptability. In the context of metagenomics, plasmids are identified alongside chromosomal DNA.</p>

<p>A common step in metaplasmidome analysis is searching sequencing reads against known plasmid databases to detect plasmid sequences within a metagenome, allowing researchers to map the diversity and abundance of plasmids in various environments.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we use a metaplasmidome database built from public air metagenomes and query it with assembled air metagenome data. A similar approach can be used for other mobile genetic elements.</p>

<blockquote class="details">
  <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-how-was-built-the-air-metaplasmidome-database"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-how-was-built-the-air-metaplasmidome-database" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: How was built the air metaplasmidome database?</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>The air metaplasmidome is available from Zenodo (<span class="citation"><a href="#debroas_2024_11124657">DEBROAS 2024</a></span>) and was built from metagenomic data selected in Web of Science (Clarivate) on October 2022 using keywords: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">txid655179[Organism:noexp] AND metagenome [Filter]; AIR Metagenome; Air microbiome; Troposphere; Aerosol; Atmosphere</code>. Data were manually curated to remove sequencing originated from metabarcoding data (i.e., 16S). The assembled data supplied by MetaSUB consortium (<span class="citation"><a href="#danko2021global">Danko <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>) when available was used for air metagenome in the built environments.</p>

  <p>Plasmid contents were predicted using the assembled data. Metagenomes sequencing by Illumina (paired-illumina reads) were assembled by using MEGAHIT 1.2.9 with metalarge option (<span class="citation"><a href="#li2015">Li <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>) after cleaning data with bbduk2 (qtrim=rl trimq=28 minlen=25 maq=20 ktrim=r k=25 mink=11 and a list of adaptators to remove) from <a href="https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/">bbtools suite</a></p>

  <p>Plasmids were predicted for each assembling by using PlasSuite scripts describing in-depth in Hilpert et al. <span class="citation"><a href="#hilpert2021reconstruction">Hilpert <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span> <span class="citation"><a href="#hennequin2022plasmidome">Hennequin <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span> and available on <a href="https://github.com/meb-team/PlasSuite/">GitHub</a>. Briefly, contigs were analyzed using both reference-based and reference-free approaches. The databases employed included those for chromosomes (archaea and bacteria) and plasmids from NCBI, as well as the MOB-suite tool (<span class="citation"><a href="#robertson2018mob">Robertson and Nash 2018</a></span>), SILVA (<span class="citation"><a href="#quast2012silva">Quast <i>et al.</i> 2012</a></span>) and phylogenetic markers harbored by chromosomes (<span class="citation"><a href="#wu2013systematic">Wu <i>et al.</i> 2013</a></span>). Two reference-free methods were applied to contigs that were not affiliated with chromosomes (discarded) or plasmids (retained in the first step): PlasFlow (<span class="citation"><a href="#krawczyk2018plasflow">Krawczyk <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>) and PlasClass (<span class="citation"><a href="#pellow2020plasclass">Pellow <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>). Viruses were removed by using <a href="https://github.com/ablab/viralVerify">viralVerify</a> (<span class="citation"><a href="#antipov2020metaviral">Antipov <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>) that provides in parallel provide plasmid/non-plasmid classification.</p>

  <p>Eukaryotes contaminants were removed by aligning the sequences against NT databases and human chromosomes (GRCh38) with minimap2 with -x asm5 option (<span class="citation"><a href="#li2018minimap2">Li 2018</a></span>). Contigs mapping with an identity of 95% and a coverage of 80% were removed.  the final plasmidome set was clustered by mmseqs (<span class="citation"><a href="#mirdita2019mmseqs2">Mirdita <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>) with 80% of coverage and 90% of identity (–min-seq-id 0.90 -c 0.8 –cov-mode 1 –cluster-mode 2 –alignment-mode 3 –kmer-per-seq-scale 0.2).</p>

<p>We should remove alignments with a score below 40. Before that, let’s look at the plasmid coverage. We first need to compute it, i.e. the ratio between the number of matching bases in the mapping (Column 10) and plasmid length (target sequence length - Column 7).</p>

<h1 id="extract-sequences-mapping-to-plasmids">Extract sequences mapping to plasmids</h1>

<p>Let’s now extract the sequences mapping to plasmids (coverage higher than 80%).</p>

<p>First, we need to extract the names of the reads (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">air metagenomes</code>) mapping to plasmids in the metaplasmidome database. For that, we need to extract column 1 (query names, i.e. names of reads in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Air metagenomes</code>) and 6 (reference names, i.e. names of sequences in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Air plasmidome database</code>).</p>

<p>This file is a GFF: it describes genes and other features of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. It is a tab-delimited file with 9 fields per line:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>seqid</strong>: The name of the sequence where the feature is located.</li>
  <li><strong>source</strong>: The algorithm or procedure that generated the feature.</li>
  <li><strong>type</strong>: The feature type name, like “gene” or “exon”.</li>
  <li><strong>start</strong>: Genomic start of the feature, with a 1-base offset.</li>
  <li><strong>end</strong>: Genomic end of the feature, with a 1-base offset.</li>
  <li><strong>score</strong>: Numeric value that generally indicates the confidence of the source in the annotated feature.</li>
  <li><strong>strand</strong>: Single character that indicates the strand of the feature.</li>
  <li><strong>phase</strong>: Phase of CDS features.</li>
  <li><strong>attributes</strong>: A list of tag-value pairs separated by a semicolon with additional information about the feature.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>seqid</strong> corresponds here to the ID of the sequences in the metaplasmidome reference database.

<p>We have now a file with 26,329 lines. The 2nd column is not useful so we will remove it. Column 3 (<strong>atributes</strong> in GFF) lists tag-value pairs separated by a semicolon with additional information about the feature.
The first lines seems to be hypothetical proteins. If we scroll down, we can find some annotated genes (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gene</code> keyword).</p>

<p>It would be good to create a tabular file with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Metagenomic sequence name</li>
  <li>Gene ID</li>
  <li>Gene name</li>
  <li>Gene product</li>
</ol>

<p>As not all genes are annotated (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gene</code> keyword), we first need to split the file between hypothetical proteins and annotated genes and process the two generated files independently.</p>
