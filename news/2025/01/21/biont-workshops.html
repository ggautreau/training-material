    <h1 id="biont-basic-curriculum-round-two---starting-in-autumn-2024-with-the-rna-seq-and-python-workshops">BioNT basic curriculum Round Two - Starting in autumn 2024 with the RNA-Seq and Python Workshops</h1>

<p>Like the previous year, two <a href="https://biont-training.eu/"><strong>BioNT</strong></a> workshops were organized with the support of the Galaxy Training Network. We were delighted to launch the second round of the basic BioNT curriculum with our RNA-seq and Python workshop.</p>

<p>The BioNT consortium is committed to offering a robust training program and cultivating a community equipped with digital skills pertinent to the biotechnology industry and biomedical sector. All BioNT workshops are conducted online, featuring real-time communication through shared documents. This interactive setup ensures that, in addition to the instructor, several helpers are available to promptly address questions and resolve issues that participants encounter during the workshop.</p>

<h2 id="a-practical-introduction-to-bioinformatics-and-rna-seq-using-galaxy">A practical introduction to bioinformatics and RNA-seq using Galaxy</h2>

<p>The second round of our Python workshop took place from September 10th to 13th, 2024. Interested participants were invited to register through the <a href="https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/a-practical-introduction-to-bioinformatics-and-rna-seq-using-galaxy-1359">event page</a> on CECAM, which provided a detailed summary of the workshop’s content and schedule.</p>

<p>This workshop offered a <strong>hands-on</strong> introduction to bioinformatics, where key concepts in sequencing data analysis were discussed, alongside a comprehensive overview of bioinformatics data analysis techniques. The emphasis was on <strong>RNA-sequencing</strong>, a method that has revolutionized genomics and healthcare research due to its high-throughput capabilities and relative cost-effectiveness. With the advancement of computational tools for data analysis, RNA-sequencing has greatly enhanced our understanding of RNA biology.</p>

<p>For insights into the first round of the RNA-seq workshop, you can read more in our <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-09-28-biont-workshop/">blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-logistics">Workshop Logistics</h3>

<p>The workshop utilized the <strong>Galaxy Training Network (GTN)</strong> learning materials and was hosted on the <strong>European Galaxy server</strong>. Galaxy, an open-source platform, facilitates accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research. It offers a conducive learning environment with all the necessary tools and resources, featuring a user-friendly interface. This setup allows participants to focus on the content without being hindered by local technical issues. Additionally, the workshop was supported by a dedicated job queue and resources provided via <strong>Training Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<a href="https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/">TIaaS</a>). This service also equipped instructors with a dashboard to monitor participants’ progress effectively.</p>

<p>The workshop took place from September 10th to 13th, entirely online via a Zoom webinar, featuring only the instructors. A key component was the shared document, referred to as the <strong>Main Document</strong>, which was accessible to all participants throughout the session. This document provided a structured communication platform with designated sections for each workshop part, where participants could pose questions or share their progress on tasks. The Main Document was progressively constructed from a <strong>pre-prepared Template</strong> Document. All conversations of the main document are stored in a <strong><a href="https://biont.biobyte.de/s/j0r79-fl1#">History document</a></strong>, which was shared with the participants as well.</p>

<p>Before the workshop, instructors and helpers meet for a test-run the workshop and clarify roles and responsibilities. Communication among the team during the workshop was facilitated through Matrix, a chat platform, in a dedicated channel. A total of four instructors and seven helpers ensured the smooth execution of the workshop.</p>

<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>

<p>Similar to the previous year, registration opened in June, three and a half months before the workshop, and closed in August without an extension due to overwhelming interest - almost triple that of the first round. This year, we received <strong>170 applications</strong>, necessitating a selection process as the workshop had a capacity limit of 60 participants.</p>

<p>As a project funded by the European Union, BioNT’s selection criteria were carefully chosen to target the audience specified by the funding requirements. Participants were selected based on three criteria: (1) being a job seeker, (2) working in or having a connection to an SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprise), and (3) being employed in a European country. Additionally, completion of the pre-workshop survey, a requirement for the application, was verified.</p>

<p>In total, we accepted 61 participants, of which 52 actively engaged in the workshop. At the workshop’s conclusion, 27 certificates were distributed to those who requested on and met the completion criteria.</p>

<h3 id="outcomes-and-feedback">Outcomes and Feedback</h3>

<p>Most applicants joined the workshop to acquire new skills relevant to their current or future job roles. Over half of the applicants were already familiar with Galaxy, with some using it on a daily basis. Consequently, participants were given the option to skip the initial introductory day if they did not require a basic overview of Galaxy.</p>

<p>Throughout the workshop, participants were engaged through affirmative feedback prompts and had the opportunity to request additional time as needed. This approach ensured that those who wished to follow along live could do so effectively. On the final day, there was a noticeable split between participants who wished to proceed at the planned pace and those who needed more time to complete assignments, leading to some frustration due to the necessity to condense the content towards the end. However, since the GTN learning materials are designed for self-paced study, participants could complete the course on their own time. Additionally, a shared document where participant could addressing questions and seek out for help was made available throughout the week following the workshop. For the next round an assessment of the different knowledge levels of the participants can be beneficial.</p>

<p>Feedback from the post-workshop survey was overwhelmingly positive, with all respondents either agreeing or strongly agreeing with the following statements: (1) I felt comfortable learning in this workshop environment, (2) I can immediately apply what I learned at this workshop, (3) I was able to get clear answers to my questions from the instructors, (4) The instructors were enthusiastic about the workshop, (5) I felt comfortable interacting with the instructors, and (6) The instructors were knowledgeable about the material taught.</p>

<p>Almost all participants expressed their intention to reuse the training resources, and all were very likely to recommend this workshop to a friend or colleague.</p>

<h2 id="from-zero-to-hero-with-python">From Zero to Hero with Python</h2>

<p>The second iteration of the <strong>BioNT Python workshop</strong>, called ‘From Zero to Hero with Python’, took place from October 17th to 18th, 2024. Interested participants were invited to register via the <a href="https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/from-zero-to-hero-with-python-1362">event page</a>, which provided detailed information about the workshop’s content and schedule.</p>

<p>This hands-on introduction to Python 3 covered fundamental programming concepts and their practical applications. Participants were introduced to essential libraries for data analysis and techniques for visualizing results. Python is known for its approachability and effectiveness, making it an ideal choice for those beginning their programming journey.</p>

<p>If you are interested to read up about the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-11-21-2nd-biont-workshop/">first round of the Python workshop</a>, have a look at the blog post.</p>

<p>For more insights into the initial Python workshop, you can explore the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-11-21-2nd-biont-workshop/">blog post</a> about the first round.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-logistics-1">Workshop logistics</h3>

<p>The workshop was conducted using learning materials from [<strong>The Carpentries</strong>](https://carpentries.org/index, known for their community-driven development and extensive validation through workshop evaluations. This approach ensured that the content was both robust and user-friendly.</p>

<p>To facilitate a smooth experience, installation instructions were provided ahead of time, along with scheduled help sessions for those who requested assistance. Participants received a checklist to test their setups prior to the workshop, ensuring that all technical requirements were met.</p>

<p>Held on October 17th and 18th, the workshop was entirely online and offered at no cost. Sessions ran from 09:00 to 15:00 CET and were delivered via a Zoom webinar format. To protect participant privacy, their visibility was disabled; however, they could still view and learn from the trainers. Direct interaction, such as chat or voice communication, was not available in Zoom during the sessions.</p>

<p>Throughout the workshop, all interactions were facilitated through a shared document, allowing for real-time engagement. A <a href="https://biont.biobyte.de/s/a5fI42MC8#">History document</a> capturing the entire conversation was accessible to participants even after the workshop, providing a valuable resource for review and continued learning.</p>

<h3 id="attendance-1">Attendance</h3>

<p>For the second installment of our workshop, we received a remarkable increase in interest, with <strong>107 applicants</strong> - almost double the number from the first round. Out of these, 63 participants were accepted to join the workshop. A dedicated team of 10 instructors and helpers guided the 47 participants who actively engaged throughout the session.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the workshop, 29 participants who requested and met all the requirements were awarded certificates, recognizing their successful completion and dedication.</p>

<h3 id="outcomes-and-feedback-1">Outcomes and Feedback</h3>

<p>The workshop was exceedingly well-received by participants. Almost all of them agreed or strongly agreed with the following statements: (1) I felt comfortable learning in this workshop environment, (2) I can immediately apply what I learned at this workshop, (3) I was able to get clear answers to my questions from the instructors, (4) The instructors were enthusiastic about the workshop, (5) I felt comfortable interacting with the instructors, and (6) The instructors were knowledgeable about the material being taught.</p>

<p>The participants mention that a strength of the workshop was the shared document, where they found help throughout the workshop. They did mention that the speed and the content, exercises and level of difficulty was good. And others mentioned that they feel they have a good idea about Python and are motivated to learn more.</p>

<p>Within the feedback, participants highlighted the shared document as a key resource that provided continuous support throughout the workshop. They appreciated the pace, content, and the exercises, noting that the level of difficulty was well-balanced. Many expressed that they now have a solid understanding of Python and are motivated to further their learning.</p>

<p>Some participants suggested extending the workshop duration to include more exercises and expressed a desire for additional guidance on loading data onto their local systems. This feedback will be addressed in future sessions by incorporating data loading instructions into the installation requirements, ensuring that participants can receive one-on-one help during the installation help session before the workshop begins.</p>

<p>Overall, participants were highly satisfied with the workshop, the instructors, the assistance provided, and the learning materials. They would recommend this workshop to friends and colleagues.</p>

  "articleBody": "<h1 id=\"biont-basic-curriculum-round-two---starting-in-autumn-2024-with-the-rna-seq-and-python-workshops\">BioNT basic curriculum Round Two - Starting in autumn 2024 with the RNA-Seq and Python Workshops</h1>\n\n<p>Like the previous year, two <a href=\"https://biont-training.eu/\"><strong>BioNT</strong></a> workshops were organized with the support of the Galaxy Training Network. We were delighted to launch the second round of the basic BioNT curriculum with our RNA-seq and Python workshop.</p>\n\n<p>The BioNT consortium is committed to offering a robust training program and cultivating a community equipped with digital skills pertinent to the biotechnology industry and biomedical sector. All BioNT workshops are conducted online, featuring real-time communication through shared documents. This interactive setup ensures that, in addition to the instructor, several helpers are available to promptly address questions and resolve issues that participants encounter during the workshop.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-practical-introduction-to-bioinformatics-and-rna-seq-using-galaxy\">A practical introduction to bioinformatics and RNA-seq using Galaxy</h2>\n\n<p>The second round of our Python workshop took place from September 10th to 13th, 2024. Interested participants were invited to register through the <a href=\"https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/a-practical-introduction-to-bioinformatics-and-rna-seq-using-galaxy-1359\">event page</a> on CECAM, which provided a detailed summary of the workshop’s content and schedule.</p>\n\n<p>This workshop offered a <strong>hands-on</strong> introduction to bioinformatics, where key concepts in sequencing data analysis were discussed, alongside a comprehensive overview of bioinformatics data analysis techniques. The emphasis was on <strong>RNA-sequencing</strong>, a method that has revolutionized genomics and healthcare research due to its high-throughput capabilities and relative cost-effectiveness. With the advancement of computational tools for data analysis, RNA-sequencing has greatly enhanced our understanding of RNA biology.</p>\n\n<p>For insights into the first round of the RNA-seq workshop, you can read more in our <a href=\"https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-09-28-biont-workshop/\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"workshop-logistics\">Workshop Logistics</h3>\n\n<p>The workshop utilized the <strong>Galaxy Training Network (GTN)</strong> learning materials and was hosted on the <strong>European Galaxy server</strong>. Galaxy, an open-source platform, facilitates accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research. It offers a conducive learning environment with all the necessary tools and resources, featuring a user-friendly interface. This setup allows participants to focus on the content without being hindered by local technical issues. Additionally, the workshop was supported by a dedicated job queue and resources provided via <strong>Training Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<a href=\"https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/\">TIaaS</a>). This service also equipped instructors with a dashboard to monitor participants’ progress effectively.</p>\n\n<p>The workshop took place from September 10th to 13th, entirely online via a Zoom webinar, featuring only the instructors. A key component was the shared document, referred to as the <strong>Main Document</strong>, which was accessible to all participants throughout the session. This document provided a structured communication platform with designated sections for each workshop part, where participants could pose questions or share their progress on tasks. The Main Document was progressively constructed from a <strong>pre-prepared Template</strong> Document. All conversations of the main document are stored in a <strong><a href=\"https://biont.biobyte.de/s/j0r79-fl1#\">History document</a></strong>, which was shared with the participants as well.</p>\n\n<p>Before the workshop, instructors and helpers meet for a test-run the workshop and clarify roles and responsibilities. Communication among the team during the workshop was facilitated through Matrix, a chat platform, in a dedicated channel. A total of four instructors and seven helpers ensured the smooth execution of the workshop.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"attendance\">Attendance</h3>\n\n<p>Similar to the previous year, registration opened in June, three and a half months before the workshop, and closed in August without an extension due to overwhelming interest - almost triple that of the first round. This year, we received <strong>170 applications</strong>, necessitating a selection process as the workshop had a capacity limit of 60 participants.</p>\n\n<p>As a project funded by the European Union, BioNT’s selection criteria were carefully chosen to target the audience specified by the funding requirements. Participants were selected based on three criteria: (1) being a job seeker, (2) working in or having a connection to an SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprise), and (3) being employed in a European country. Additionally, completion of the pre-workshop survey, a requirement for the application, was verified.</p>\n\n<p>In total, we accepted 61 participants, of which 52 actively engaged in the workshop. At the workshop’s conclusion, 27 certificates were distributed to those who requested on and met the completion criteria.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"outcomes-and-feedback\">Outcomes and Feedback</h3>\n\n<p>Most applicants joined the workshop to acquire new skills relevant to their current or future job roles. Over half of the applicants were already familiar with Galaxy, with some using it on a daily basis. Consequently, participants were given the option to skip the initial introductory day if they did not require a basic overview of Galaxy.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the workshop, participants were engaged through affirmative feedback prompts and had the opportunity to request additional time as needed. This approach ensured that those who wished to follow along live could do so effectively. On the final day, there was a noticeable split between participants who wished to proceed at the planned pace and those who needed more time to complete assignments, leading to some frustration due to the necessity to condense the content towards the end. However, since the GTN learning materials are designed for self-paced study, participants could complete the course on their own time. Additionally, a shared document where participant could addressing questions and seek out for help was made available throughout the week following the workshop. For the next round an assessment of the different knowledge levels of the participants can be beneficial.</p>\n\n<p>Feedback from the post-workshop survey was overwhelmingly positive, with all respondents either agreeing or strongly agreeing with the following statements: (1) I felt comfortable learning in this workshop environment, (2) I can immediately apply what I learned at this workshop, (3) I was able to get clear answers to my questions from the instructors, (4) The instructors were enthusiastic about the workshop, (5) I felt comfortable interacting with the instructors, and (6) The instructors were knowledgeable about the material taught.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all participants expressed their intention to reuse the training resources, and all were very likely to recommend this workshop to a friend or colleague.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"from-zero-to-hero-with-python\">From Zero to Hero with Python</h2>\n\n<p>The second iteration of the <strong>BioNT Python workshop</strong>, called ‘From Zero to Hero with Python’, took place from October 17th to 18th, 2024. Interested participants were invited to register via the <a href=\"https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/from-zero-to-hero-with-python-1362\">event page</a>, which provided detailed information about the workshop’s content and schedule.</p>\n\n<p>This hands-on introduction to Python 3 covered fundamental programming concepts and their practical applications. Participants were introduced to essential libraries for data analysis and techniques for visualizing results. Python is known for its approachability and effectiveness, making it an ideal choice for those beginning their programming journey.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested to read up about the <a href=\"https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-11-21-2nd-biont-workshop/\">first round of the Python workshop</a>, have a look at the blog post.</p>\n\n<p>For more insights into the initial Python workshop, you can explore the <a href=\"https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-11-21-2nd-biont-workshop/\">blog post</a> about the first round.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"workshop-logistics-1\">Workshop logistics</h3>\n\n<p>The workshop was conducted using learning materials from [<strong>The Carpentries</strong>](https://carpentries.org/index, known for their community-driven development and extensive validation through workshop evaluations. This approach ensured that the content was both robust and user-friendly.</p>\n\n<p>To facilitate a smooth experience, installation instructions were provided ahead of time, along with scheduled help sessions for those who requested assistance. Participants received a checklist to test their setups prior to the workshop, ensuring that all technical requirements were met.</p>\n\n<p>Held on October 17th and 18th, the workshop was entirely online and offered at no cost. Sessions ran from 09:00 to 15:00 CET and were delivered via a Zoom webinar format. To protect participant privacy, their visibility was disabled; however, they could still view and learn from the trainers. Direct interaction, such as chat or voice communication, was not available in Zoom during the sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the workshop, all interactions were facilitated through a shared document, allowing for real-time engagement. A <a href=\"https://biont.biobyte.de/s/a5fI42MC8#\">History document</a> capturing the entire conversation was accessible to participants even after the workshop, providing a valuable resource for review and continued learning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"attendance-1\">Attendance</h3>\n\n<p>For the second installment of our workshop, we received a remarkable increase in interest, with <strong>107 applicants</strong> - almost double the number from the first round. Out of these, 63 participants were accepted to join the workshop. A dedicated team of 10 instructors and helpers guided the 47 participants who actively engaged throughout the session.</p>\n\n<p>At the conclusion of the workshop, 29 participants who requested and met all the requirements were awarded certificates, recognizing their successful completion and dedication.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"outcomes-and-feedback-1\">Outcomes and Feedback</h3>\n\n<p>The workshop was exceedingly well-received by participants. Almost all of them agreed or strongly agreed with the following statements: (1) I felt comfortable learning in this workshop environment, (2) I can immediately apply what I learned at this workshop, (3) I was able to get clear answers to my questions from the instructors, (4) The instructors were enthusiastic about the workshop, (5) I felt comfortable interacting with the instructors, and (6) The instructors were knowledgeable about the material being taught.</p>\n\n<p>The participants mention that a strength of the workshop was the shared document, where they found help throughout the workshop. They did mention that the speed and the content, exercises and level of difficulty was good. And others mentioned that they feel they have a good idea about Python and are motivated to learn more.</p>\n\n<p>Within the feedback, participants highlighted the shared document as a key resource that provided continuous support throughout the workshop. They appreciated the pace, content, and the exercises, noting that the level of difficulty was well-balanced. Many expressed that they now have a solid understanding of Python and are motivated to further their learning.</p>\n\n<p>Some participants suggested extending the workshop duration to include more exercises and expressed a desire for additional guidance on loading data onto their local systems. This feedback will be addressed in future sessions by incorporating data loading instructions into the installation requirements, ensuring that participants can receive one-on-one help during the installation help session before the workshop begins.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, participants were highly satisfied with the workshop, the instructors, the assistance provided, and the learning materials. They would recommend this workshop to friends and colleagues.</p>\n\n",
