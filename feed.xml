<p>Like the previous year, two <a href="https://biont-training.eu/"><strong>BioNT</strong></a> workshops were organized with the support of the Galaxy Training Network. We were delighted to launch the second round of the basic BioNT curriculum with our RNA-seq and Python workshop.</p>

<p>The BioNT consortium is committed to offering a robust training program and cultivating a community equipped with digital skills pertinent to the biotechnology industry and biomedical sector. All BioNT workshops are conducted online, featuring real-time communication through shared documents. This interactive setup ensures that, in addition to the instructor, several helpers are available to promptly address questions and resolve issues that participants encounter during the workshop.</p>

<h2 id="a-practical-introduction-to-bioinformatics-and-rna-seq-using-galaxy">A practical introduction to bioinformatics and RNA-seq using Galaxy</h2>

<p>The second round of our Python workshop took place from September 10th to 13th, 2024. Interested participants were invited to register through the <a href="https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/a-practical-introduction-to-bioinformatics-and-rna-seq-using-galaxy-1359">event page</a> on CECAM, which provided a detailed summary of the workshop’s content and schedule.</p>

<p>This workshop offered a <strong>hands-on</strong> introduction to bioinformatics, where key concepts in sequencing data analysis were discussed, alongside a comprehensive overview of bioinformatics data analysis techniques. The emphasis was on <strong>RNA-sequencing</strong>, a method that has revolutionized genomics and healthcare research due to its high-throughput capabilities and relative cost-effectiveness. With the advancement of computational tools for data analysis, RNA-sequencing has greatly enhanced our understanding of RNA biology.</p>

<p>For insights into the first round of the RNA-seq workshop, you can read more in our <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-09-28-biont-workshop/">blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-logistics">Workshop Logistics</h3>

<p>The workshop utilized the <strong>Galaxy Training Network (GTN)</strong> learning materials and was hosted on the <strong>European Galaxy server</strong>. Galaxy, an open-source platform, facilitates accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research. It offers a conducive learning environment with all the necessary tools and resources, featuring a user-friendly interface. This setup allows participants to focus on the content without being hindered by local technical issues. Additionally, the workshop was supported by a dedicated job queue and resources provided via <strong>Training Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<a href="https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/">TIaaS</a>). This service also equipped instructors with a dashboard to monitor participants’ progress effectively.</p>

<p>The workshop took place from September 10th to 13th, entirely online via a Zoom webinar, featuring only the instructors. A key component was the shared document, referred to as the <strong>Main Document</strong>, which was accessible to all participants throughout the session. This document provided a structured communication platform with designated sections for each workshop part, where participants could pose questions or share their progress on tasks. The Main Document was progressively constructed from a <strong>pre-prepared Template</strong> Document. All conversations of the main document are stored in a <strong><a href="https://biont.biobyte.de/s/j0r79-fl1#">History document</a></strong>, which was shared with the participants as well.</p>

<p>Before the workshop, instructors and helpers meet for a test-run the workshop and clarify roles and responsibilities. Communication among the team during the workshop was facilitated through Matrix, a chat platform, in a dedicated channel. A total of four instructors and seven helpers ensured the smooth execution of the workshop.</p>

<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>

<p>Similar to the previous year, registration opened in June, three and a half months before the workshop, and closed in August without an extension due to overwhelming interest - almost triple that of the first round. This year, we received <strong>170 applications</strong>, necessitating a selection process as the workshop had a capacity limit of 60 participants.</p>

<p>As a project funded by the European Union, BioNT’s selection criteria were carefully chosen to target the audience specified by the funding requirements. Participants were selected based on three criteria: (1) being a job seeker, (2) working in or having a connection to an SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprise), and (3) being employed in a European country. Additionally, completion of the pre-workshop survey, a requirement for the application, was verified.</p>

<p>In total, we accepted 61 participants, of which 52 actively engaged in the workshop. At the workshop’s conclusion, 27 certificates were distributed to those who requested on and met the completion criteria.</p>

<h3 id="outcomes-and-feedback">Outcomes and Feedback</h3>

<p>Most applicants joined the workshop to acquire new skills relevant to their current or future job roles. Over half of the applicants were already familiar with Galaxy, with some using it on a daily basis. Consequently, participants were given the option to skip the initial introductory day if they did not require a basic overview of Galaxy.</p>

<p>Throughout the workshop, participants were engaged through affirmative feedback prompts and had the opportunity to request additional time as needed. This approach ensured that those who wished to follow along live could do so effectively. On the final day, there was a noticeable split between participants who wished to proceed at the planned pace and those who needed more time to complete assignments, leading to some frustration due to the necessity to condense the content towards the end. However, since the GTN learning materials are designed for self-paced study, participants could complete the course on their own time. Additionally, a shared document where participant could addressing questions and seek out for help was made available throughout the week following the workshop. For the next round an assessment of the different knowledge levels of the participants can be beneficial.</p>

<p>Feedback from the post-workshop survey was overwhelmingly positive, with all respondents either agreeing or strongly agreeing with the following statements: (1) I felt comfortable learning in this workshop environment, (2) I can immediately apply what I learned at this workshop, (3) I was able to get clear answers to my questions from the instructors, (4) The instructors were enthusiastic about the workshop, (5) I felt comfortable interacting with the instructors, and (6) The instructors were knowledgeable about the material taught.</p>

<p>Almost all participants expressed their intention to reuse the training resources, and all were very likely to recommend this workshop to a friend or colleague.</p>

<h2 id="from-zero-to-hero-with-python">From Zero to Hero with Python</h2>

<p>The second iteration of the <strong>BioNT Python workshop</strong>, called ‘From Zero to Hero with Python’, took place from October 17th to 18th, 2024. Interested participants were invited to register via the <a href="https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/from-zero-to-hero-with-python-1362">event page</a>, which provided detailed information about the workshop’s content and schedule.</p>

<p>This hands-on introduction to Python 3 covered fundamental programming concepts and their practical applications. Participants were introduced to essential libraries for data analysis and techniques for visualizing results. Python is known for its approachability and effectiveness, making it an ideal choice for those beginning their programming journey.</p>

<p>If you are interested to read up about the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-11-21-2nd-biont-workshop/">first round of the Python workshop</a>, have a look at the blog post.</p>

<p>For more insights into the initial Python workshop, you can explore the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-11-21-2nd-biont-workshop/">blog post</a> about the first round.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-logistics-1">Workshop logistics</h3>

<p>The workshop was conducted using learning materials from [<strong>The Carpentries</strong>](https://carpentries.org/index, known for their community-driven development and extensive validation through workshop evaluations. This approach ensured that the content was both robust and user-friendly.</p>

<p>To facilitate a smooth experience, installation instructions were provided ahead of time, along with scheduled help sessions for those who requested assistance. Participants received a checklist to test their setups prior to the workshop, ensuring that all technical requirements were met.</p>

<p>Held on October 17th and 18th, the workshop was entirely online and offered at no cost. Sessions ran from 09:00 to 15:00 CET and were delivered via a Zoom webinar format. To protect participant privacy, their visibility was disabled; however, they could still view and learn from the trainers. Direct interaction, such as chat or voice communication, was not available in Zoom during the sessions.</p>

<p>Throughout the workshop, all interactions were facilitated through a shared document, allowing for real-time engagement. A <a href="https://biont.biobyte.de/s/a5fI42MC8#">History document</a> capturing the entire conversation was accessible to participants even after the workshop, providing a valuable resource for review and continued learning.</p>

<h3 id="attendance-1">Attendance</h3>

<p>For the second installment of our workshop, we received a remarkable increase in interest, with <strong>107 applicants</strong> - almost double the number from the first round. Out of these, 63 participants were accepted to join the workshop. A dedicated team of 10 instructors and helpers guided the 47 participants who actively engaged throughout the session.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the workshop, 29 participants who requested and met all the requirements were awarded certificates, recognizing their successful completion and dedication.</p>

<h3 id="outcomes-and-feedback-1">Outcomes and Feedback</h3>

<p>The workshop was exceedingly well-received by participants. Almost all of them agreed or strongly agreed with the following statements: (1) I felt comfortable learning in this workshop environment, (2) I can immediately apply what I learned at this workshop, (3) I was able to get clear answers to my questions from the instructors, (4) The instructors were enthusiastic about the workshop, (5) I felt comfortable interacting with the instructors, and (6) The instructors were knowledgeable about the material being taught.</p>

<p>The participants mention that a strength of the workshop was the shared document, where they found help throughout the workshop. They did mention that the speed and the content, exercises and level of difficulty was good. And others mentioned that they feel they have a good idea about Python and are motivated to learn more.</p>

<p>Within the feedback, participants highlighted the shared document as a key resource that provided continuous support throughout the workshop. They appreciated the pace, content, and the exercises, noting that the level of difficulty was well-balanced. Many expressed that they now have a solid understanding of Python and are motivated to further their learning.</p>

<p>Some participants suggested extending the workshop duration to include more exercises and expressed a desire for additional guidance on loading data onto their local systems. This feedback will be addressed in future sessions by incorporating data loading instructions into the installation requirements, ensuring that participants can receive one-on-one help during the installation help session before the workshop begins.</p>

<p>Overall, participants were highly satisfied with the workshop, the instructors, the assistance provided, and the learning materials. They would recommend this workshop to friends and colleagues.</p>]]></content><author><name>Teresa Müller</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="gtn" /><category term="event" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[BioNT basic curriculum Round Two - Starting in autumn 2024 with the RNA-Seq and Python Workshops]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GTN’s Gift for 2024</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/12/19/community_page.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GTN’s Gift for 2024" /><published>2024-12-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/12/19/community_page</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/12/19/community_page.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="community-pages">Community Pages</h1>

<p>The Galaxy Training Network (GTN) participated with a poster, a lightning talk, and a mini hackathon. The poster and lightning talk showcased the GTN’s capabilities and opportunities, facilitating valuable connections with interested attendees. These interactions led to insightful discussions and questions about the GTN, for which we are grateful.</p>

<p>The hackathon, titled ‘Find out what the Galaxy Training Network is, by actively tackling a small task on the GTN,’ offered participants a hands-on introduction to our infrastructure and how to contribute to the GTN. The diverse needs and interests of the attendees were well-served by our flexible task approach.</p>

<p>The event featured three inspiring keynote presentations. Malvika Sharan from The Alan Turing Institute delivered impactful insights on effective community management and engagement strategies, an area we continually strive to enhance at GTN. Radhika S. Khetani from AstraZeneca shared her experiences of cultivating an educational community in academia and subsequently transferring her expertise to industry, providing a fascinating glimpse into both sectors. Finally, Yanina Bellini Saibene from ROpenSci inspired attendees with her talk on pursuing tasks in training and community involvement that can lead to career opportunities and how meaningful impact measuring is.</p>

<p>Generous breaks between workshops and breakout discussions provided many opportunities for attendees to network with peers from other learning communities, share ideas, and forge new connections. This event proved immensely fruitful for us, leaving us inspired and enriched with new contacts and ideas.</p>

<p>We extend our heartfelt thanks to all who organized, contributed to the program, and participated in making CarpentryConnect2024 a truly enjoyable and rewarding experience.

<p>As we orbit the end of another stellar year, let’s engage warp drive and reflect on the out-of-this-world achievements of the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/singlecell/"><strong>Single-cell &amp; sPatial Omics Community (SPOC 🖖)</strong></a>. From launching new tools to charting new tutorials, SPOC’s journey through the Galaxy (platform) has been nothing short of cosmic! 🌠</p>

<h2 id="-the-mission-empowering-single-cell-scientists">🌟 The Mission: Empowering Single-Cell Scientists</h2>
<p>This year, we continued to boldly go where no omics community has gone before, propelling the SPOC ecosystem beyond single-cell RNA sequencing. With new training materials, tools, and workflows, our community has bridged the gap between transcriptomics, multiomics, and even spatial data analysis, ensuring that researchers have the tools they need to explore biological frontiers. Think of it as assembling the ultimate research starship! 🚀</p>

<h2 id="-spoc-a-nebula-of-collaboration">🌌 SPOC: A Nebula of Collaboration</h2>
<p>Our <a href="/training-material/events/2024-10-29-spoc-write-a-thon.html">Write-a-thons</a> this year were true cosmic collisions of brilliance, bringing together contributors to polish workflows and draft tutorials. We also unified SPOC’s subdomains into one hyper-efficient portal with our friends from Australia. The community’s fusion power—collaboration—continues to drive SPOC’s development at lightspeed, with the launch of our first <a href="/training-material/news/2024/12/06/spoc_cofest.html">SPOC Collaboration Fest</a> that brought Galaxy and non-Galaxy single-cell scientists together to sustain our ever-expanding galaxy of omics science. The GTN mission control kept engineering stellar widgets for the SPOC galaxy, unveiling a shiny new constellation layout for our training page and advanced asteroid-sifting tools to navigate the meteoric flow of events and news from our community!</p>

<h2 id="-tools-and-tutorials-a-star-cluster-of-resources">🌠 Tools and Tutorials: A Star Cluster of Resources</h2>
<p>In 2024, SPOC added <strong>15 new tools and 6 new training resources</strong> to the Galaxy Training Network (GTN)—a constellation that lights the way for researchers navigating the complexities of single-cell and spatial omics. The introduction of SnapATAC2 and Squidpy tools felt like finding life-supporting planets in uncharted galaxies. These additions - and our wider commitment to sustainability and updating materials - ensure our workflows are as sharp as a lightsaber. ✨🛠️</p>

<h2 id="-research-data-management-guiding-stars-for-fair-practices">🚀 Research Data Management: Guiding Stars for FAIR Practices</h2>
<p>Following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles, SPOC emphasized <strong>sustainability</strong> by implementing best practices in data archiving and tool maintenance. We co-led a BioHackathon Europe project with our fellow Microbiome commanders aimed at effectively labelling our tools and building the single-cell toolshed category. From tutorials on history-sharing to archiving for training data preservation, we’re keeping our resources as eternal as starlight. 🌟</p>

<h2 id="-spocs-global-universe">🌍 SPOC’s Global Universe</h2>
<p>With SPOC’s unified platform, global events, rolling timezones, and sustainability prioritisation of user testing across servers, we’ve brought researchers from every corner of the planet into our orbit. Whether you’re beaming in from Europe, the Americas, or the Andromeda Galaxy (or maybe Australia), SPOC’s resources remain accessible, scalable, and universal.</p>

<h2 id="-looking-to-the-horizon">🌌 Looking to the Horizon</h2>
<p>As SPOC’s starship accelerates toward 2025, we’ll continue to explore new omics territories and deepen our cosmic connections across the Galaxy. Thank you to every SPOC cadet, captain, and commander who contributed this year—you’ve made SPOC the brightest star in the bioinformatics universe!</p>

<p>Keep reaching for the stars, SPOC-nauts! 🪐✨</p>

 requested the ability to annotate reviewers of a tutorial. What a great idea! We needed a way to give credit to the reviewers who have contributed to the GTN tutorials, as it is usually a somewhat thankless job, there is not a lot of visibility in reviewing code even though it is an incredibly valuable step in the process of developing (e-)learning materials. We quickly <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/commit/bce05249d60f571e72c4508da63433b68d243b59">implemented support</a> for that contribution role in the GTN infrastructure. Everyone can now manually annotate when a colleague or coworker reviews a tutorial outside of GitHub (as not everyone is familiar or comfortable reviewing learning materials there!)</p>

<p>However given our extensive automation, the we took that one step further! The GTN has recently implemented a new automation that collects metadata about every pull request that is merged into the GTN. This metadata includes the reviewers of learning materials, so of course we can automatically annotate this on every single material within our codebase, leading to our updated headers including up to dozens of previously uncredited reviewers per tutorial.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to the GTN community!</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche, Wendi Bacon</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="gtn infrastructure" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="automation" /><category term="contributing" /><category term="community" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We would like to recognise and thank all of the reviewers who have contributed to the GTN tutorials; your efforts are greatly appreciated, and we are grateful for your contributions to the GTN community.

<p>This tutorial, Tracking of mitochondria and capturing mitoflashes, provides a step-by-step guide on analyzing mitoflash events in mitochondria using Galaxy. Mitoflashes are transient mitochondrial events characterized by bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane potential depolarization, and matrix alkalinization. They are linked to bioenergetic states, physiological processes (like muscle contraction and neuronal development), and may serve as markers of mitochondrial health and longevity. Our tutorial explains how to preprocess imaging data, identify mitoflash events, and quantify key parameters (amplitude, duration, and frequency) using informatics tools in Galaxy. It is designed for researchers studying mitochondrial behavior in health and disease.</p>]]></content><author><name>Diana Chiang Jurado, Leonid Kostrykin</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="bioimaging" /><category term="mitoflash" /><category term="mitochondria" /><category term="imaging" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to share that a new imaging tutorial for Tracking Mitochondria and Capturing Mitoflashes is now available in the Galaxy Training Network!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/imaging/images/detection-of-mitoflashes/Workflow_mitoflash.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/imaging/images/detection-of-mitoflashes/Workflow_mitoflash.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
