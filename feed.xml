<p>As we orbit the end of another stellar year, let’s engage warp drive and reflect on the out-of-this-world achievements of the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/singlecell/"><strong>Single-cell &amp; sPatial Omics Community (SPOC 🖖)</strong></a>. From launching new tools to charting new tutorials, SPOC’s journey through the Galaxy (platform) has been nothing short of cosmic! 🌠</p>

<h2 id="-the-mission-empowering-single-cell-scientists">🌟 The Mission: Empowering Single-Cell Scientists</h2>
<p>This year, we continued to boldly go where no omics community has gone before, propelling the SPOC ecosystem beyond single-cell RNA sequencing. With new training materials, tools, and workflows, our community has bridged the gap between transcriptomics, multiomics, and even spatial data analysis, ensuring that researchers have the tools they need to explore biological frontiers. Think of it as assembling the ultimate research starship! 🚀</p>

<h2 id="-spoc-a-nebula-of-collaboration">🌌 SPOC: A Nebula of Collaboration</h2>
<p>Our <a href="/training-material/events/2024-10-29-spoc-write-a-thon.html">Write-a-thons</a> this year were true cosmic collisions of brilliance, bringing together contributors to polish workflows and draft tutorials. We also unified SPOC’s subdomains into one hyper-efficient portal with our friends from Australia. The community’s fusion power—collaboration—continues to drive SPOC’s development at lightspeed, with the launch of our first <a href="/training-material/news/2024/12/06/spoc_cofest.html">SPOC Collaboration Fest</a> that brought Galaxy and non-Galaxy single-cell scientists together to sustain our ever-expanding galaxy of omics science. The GTN mission control kept engineering stellar widgets for the SPOC galaxy, unveiling a shiny new constellation layout for our training page and advanced asteroid-sifting tools to navigate the meteoric flow of events and news from our community!</p>

<h2 id="-tools-and-tutorials-a-star-cluster-of-resources">🌠 Tools and Tutorials: A Star Cluster of Resources</h2>
<p>In 2024, SPOC added <strong>15 new tools and 6 new training resources</strong> to the Galaxy Training Network (GTN)—a constellation that lights the way for researchers navigating the complexities of single-cell and spatial omics. The introduction of SnapATAC2 and Squidpy tools felt like finding life-supporting planets in uncharted galaxies. These additions - and our wider commitment to sustainability and updating materials - ensure our workflows are as sharp as a lightsaber. ✨🛠️</p>

<h2 id="-research-data-management-guiding-stars-for-fair-practices">🚀 Research Data Management: Guiding Stars for FAIR Practices</h2>
<p>Following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles, SPOC emphasized <strong>sustainability</strong> by implementing best practices in data archiving and tool maintenance. We co-led a BioHackathon Europe project with our fellow Microbiome commanders aimed at effectively labelling our tools and building the single-cell toolshed category. From tutorials on history-sharing to archiving for training data preservation, we’re keeping our resources as eternal as starlight. 🌟</p>

<h2 id="-spocs-global-universe">🌍 SPOC’s Global Universe</h2>
<p>With SPOC’s unified platform, global events, rolling timezones, and sustainability prioritisation of user testing across servers, we’ve brought researchers from every corner of the planet into our orbit. Whether you’re beaming in from Europe, the Americas, or the Andromeda Galaxy (or maybe Australia), SPOC’s resources remain accessible, scalable, and universal.</p>

<h2 id="-looking-to-the-horizon">🌌 Looking to the Horizon</h2>
<p>As SPOC’s starship accelerates toward 2025, we’ll continue to explore new omics territories and deepen our cosmic connections across the Galaxy. Thank you to every SPOC cadet, captain, and commander who contributed this year—you’ve made SPOC the brightest star in the bioinformatics universe!</p>

<p>Keep reaching for the stars, SPOC-nauts! 🪐✨</p>

 requested the ability to annotate reviewers of a tutorial. What a great idea! We needed a way to give credit to the reviewers who have contributed to the GTN tutorials, as it is usually a somewhat thankless job, there is not a lot of visibility in reviewing code even though it is an incredibly valuable step in the process of developing (e-)learning materials. We quickly <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/commit/bce05249d60f571e72c4508da63433b68d243b59">implemented support</a> for that contribution role in the GTN infrastructure. Everyone can now manually annotate when a colleague or coworker reviews a tutorial outside of GitHub (as not everyone is familiar or comfortable reviewing learning materials there!)</p>

<p>However given our extensive automation, the we took that one step further! The GTN has recently implemented a new automation that collects metadata about every pull request that is merged into the GTN. This metadata includes the reviewers of learning materials, so of course we can automatically annotate this on every single material within our codebase, leading to our updated headers including up to dozens of previously uncredited reviewers per tutorial.</p>

<p>This tutorial, Tracking of mitochondria and capturing mitoflashes, provides a step-by-step guide on analyzing mitoflash events in mitochondria using Galaxy. Mitoflashes are transient mitochondrial events characterized by bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane potential depolarization, and matrix alkalinization. They are linked to bioenergetic states, physiological processes (like muscle contraction and neuronal development), and may serve as markers of mitochondrial health and longevity. Our tutorial explains how to preprocess imaging data, identify mitoflash events, and quantify key parameters (amplitude, duration, and frequency) using informatics tools in Galaxy. It is designed for researchers studying mitochondrial behavior in health and disease.</p>]]></content><author><name>Diana Chiang Jurado, Leonid Kostrykin</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="bioimaging" /><category term="mitoflash" /><category term="mitochondria" /><category term="imaging" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to share that a new imaging tutorial for Tracking Mitochondria and Capturing Mitoflashes is now available in the Galaxy Training Network!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/imaging/images/detection-of-mitoflashes/Workflow_mitoflash.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/imaging/images/detection-of-mitoflashes/Workflow_mitoflash.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Galaxy Administrator Time Burden and Technology Usage</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/22/Galaxy-Administrator-Time-Burden-and-Technology-Usage.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Galaxy Administrator Time Burden and Technology Usage" /><published>2024-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/22/Galaxy-Administrator-Time-Burden-and-Technology-Usage</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/22/Galaxy-Administrator-Time-Burden-and-Technology-Usage.html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you wondered how difficult Galaxy is to run?

<p>Our users were clear: <em>GitHub, pull requests, commits, and YAML files are not always a pleasant or user-friendly way to contribute.</em></p>

<p>After the success of news contributions via form we have expanded that process significantly. Now you can contribute the following all via Google Form:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://forms.gle/TqGTr6y46wrJDri7A">News</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://forms.gle/2JVMfd1AgtenZPvv9">FAQs</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://forms.gle/qNG8FkTN1yRZPNZY6">Recordings</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://forms.gle/M6ECp1e3pZoFGYnV8">Events</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-details">The Details</h2>

<p>Each of these works similarly: you fill out the form, and then in the background a GTN GitHub Action will create a pull request for you.
The GTN maintainers will review the pull request, and when everything is in order and tests pass, merge it. Your contribution will be in the GTN without you needing to learn development tooling.</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche, Saskia Hiltemann</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="gtn infrastructure" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="automation" /><category term="contributing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the last time we announced GTN news posting via Google Form, we’ve found that this has been an excellent fit for the community and decided to greatly expand the use of Google Forms for GTN contributions.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/2024-google-forms.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/2024-google-forms.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">New Tutorial: Single-cell ATAC-seq standard processing with SnapATAC2</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/12/tutorial-snapatac-standard.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Tutorial: Single-cell ATAC-seq standard processing with SnapATAC2" /><published>2024-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/12/tutorial-snapatac-standard</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/12/tutorial-snapatac-standard.html"><![CDATA[<p>We are proud to announce that a new training, explaining the analysis of single cell ATAC-seq data with <strong>SnapATAC2</strong> and <strong>Scanpy</strong>, is now available in the Galaxy Training Network.</p>

The single cell data is first preprocessed and a high-quality count matrix is produced. Next, the dimensionality of the data is reduced and clusters visualized. Finally, clusters are manually annotated with marker genes.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The tutorial consists of three sections: Preprocessing, Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering, and Cluster Annotation. During the preprocessing, cell-by-feature count matrices are created, which are filtered to produce high-quality AnnData count matrices. After that, the dimensionality of the data is reduced through nonlinear spectral embedding. The data is then projected onto two-dimensional space and clusters are identified. To annotate the clusters, the gene activity for each cell is measured and the activity of marker genes is visualized with the <strong>Scanpy</strong> package. The activity profile of each cluster is then used to determine the correct cell type.</p>]]></content><author><name>Timon Schlegel</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new tutorial" /><category term="single-cell" /><category term="epigenetics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are proud to announce that a new training, explaining the analysis of single cell ATAC-seq data with SnapATAC2 and Scanpy, is now available in the Galaxy Training Network.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/images/scatac-standard-snapatac2/snapatac2-pipeline.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/images/scatac-standard-snapatac2/snapatac2-pipeline.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Registration Open for BioNT Community Event &amp;amp; CarpentryConnect Heidelberg</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/11/CC2024-registration.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Registration Open for BioNT Community Event &amp;amp; CarpentryConnect Heidelberg" /><published>2024-07-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/11/CC2024-registration</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2024/07/11/CC2024-registration.html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you interested in training and want to connect with other enthusiastic trainers?
